// Name: Tanner Wells 
// Vector addition on the GPU, with one block

 What to do:
 This code adds the vectors on the GPU.
 Man, that was easy!

 1. First, just add cuda to the word malloc to get cudaMalloc and use it to allocate memory on the GPU.
 Okay, you had to use an & instead of float*, but come on, that was no big deal.

 2. Use cudaMemcpyAsync to copy your CPU memory holding your vectors to the GPU.

 3. Now for the important stuff we've all been waiting for: the GPU "CUDA kernel" that does 
 the work on thousands of CUDA cores all at the same time!!!!!!!! 
 Wait, all you have to do is remove the for loop?
 Dude, that was too simple! I want my money back! 
 Be patient, it gets a little harder, but remember, I told you CUDA was simple.
 
 4. call cudaDeviceSynchronize. Sync up the CPU and the GPU. I'll expaned on this in to story at the end of 5 below.
 
 5. Use cudaMemcpyAsync again to copy your GPU memory back to the CPU.
 Be careful with cudaMemcpyAsync. Make sure you pay attention to the last argument you pass in the call.
 Also, note that it says "Async" at the end. That means the CPU tells the GPU to do the copy but doesn't wait around for it to finish.

	CPU: 	"Dude, here is your data to work on and don't bother me. It's 'Async'—I’ve got to get back to watching this cool 
		TikTok video of a guy smashing watermelons with his face."

	GPU: 	"Whatever, dude. I'll crunch your data when I get around to it. It's 'Async'."

	CPU: 	"Just make sure you get it crunched before I send the results out."

	GPU: 	"Well, maybe you'd better check with me and wait until I'm done before you start publishing results. 
		That means use cudaDeviceSynchronize!"

	CPU: 	"Da."

	GPU: 	"I might be all tied up watching a TikTok video of a guy eating hotdogs with his hands tied behind his back... underwater."

	GPU: 	thought to self: "It must be nice being a CPU, living in the administration zone where time and logic don't apply. 
		Sitting in meetings all day coming up with work for me to do!"

 6. Use cudaFree instead of free.
 What you need to do:

 The code below runs for a vector of length 500.
 Modify it so that it runs for a vector of length 1000 and check your result.
 Then, set the vector size to 1500 and check your result again. 
 This is the code you will turn in.
 
 Remember, you can only use one block!!!
 Don’t cry. I know you played with a basket full of blocks when you were a kid.
 I’ll let you play with over 60,000 blocks in the future—you’ll just have to wait.

 Be prepared to explain what you did to make this work and why it works.
 NOTE: Good code should work for any vector length!
